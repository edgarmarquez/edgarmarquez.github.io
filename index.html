<p>I'm Edgar Marquez. I earned a BA in Digital Media from Empire State College in 2011. I'm currently attending StartUp Institute in NYC. I come from a good background on HTML and CSS. I joined this class looking forward to polish up my skills and learn new ones as they come.</p>

<p>One of my passions is learning new technologies. Even though I'd love to work as Front End Developer, I wouldn't mind getting a job as UI/UX Designer.</p>
